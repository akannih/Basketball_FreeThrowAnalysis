# Basketball Player Statistics Analysis

**Overview**

This project analyzes basketball player performance metrics, focusing on Free Throws, Free Throw Attempts, and player playing style. It visualizes key insights through various plots.
Key Insights
1.	Free Throw Attempts Per Game: Visualizes the average number of free throw attempts made by each player across multiple seasons.
2.	Free Throw Accuracy: Compares the percentage of successful free throws against total attempts for each player.
3.	Player Playing Style: Assesses scoring patterns by analyzing points scored from field goals versus free throws.

**Data**
The analysis uses historical data for ten basketball players over ten seasons, covering:
•	Free Throws Made
•	Free Throw Attempts
•	Games Played
•	Points Scored
•	Field Goals Made
•	Field Goal Attempts

**Visualizations**
•	Free Throw Attempts Per Game
•	Free Throw Accuracy
•	Player Style Patterns (2 vs 3 points)

**Learnings and Insights**
1.	Understanding Player Performance: The analysis revealed significant differences in free throw attempts and accuracy among players. For example, while Chris Paul had a high free throw accuracy, his attempts per game were notably low, suggesting potential untapped scoring opportunities for his team.
2.	Player Styles and Scoring Preferences: The player style analysis highlighted the contrasting approaches to scoring between players who favor two-point versus three-point shots. This insight can inform coaching strategies and player development focusing on maximizing scoring efficiency.
3.	Impact of Free Throws on Overall Scoring: It became clear that free throws, though seemingly minor in a player's overall scoring, can significantly influence game outcomes, especially for players with lower field goal percentages.
4.	Data Visualization Skills: Creating plots using Matplotlib enhanced skills in data visualization, allowing for clearer communication of complex statistics and trends to stakeholders.
5.	Importance of Data in Sports Analytics: The project reinforced the critical role of data in evaluating player performance and making strategic decisions in basketball. By analyzing comprehensive statistics, teams can tailor their training and game strategies to improve outcomes.
